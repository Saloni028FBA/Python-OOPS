        "1. What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
        "   \n",
        "   - Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm centered around organizing code into \"objects.\"\n",
        "   \n",
        "   - These objects represent real-world entities or abstract concepts and combine data (known as attributes or properties) with actions (known as methods or behaviors).\n",
        "   \n",
        "   - OOP emphasizes modularity, reusability, and encapsulation, making it easier to manage complex software systems.\n",
        "\n",
        "   - Key Concepts of OOP:\n",
        "\n",
        "      1. Objects -> These are the fundamental building blocks.\n",
        "      \n",
        "            -> An object represents a specific instance of something, which could be a real-world entity (like a Car, User, Product) or an abstract concept (like a DatabaseConnection, FileHandler).\n",
        "\n",
        "            -> Object have state (Attributes/Properties), data that describes the object (e.g., a Car object might have color, speed, model).\n",
        "\n",
        "            -> Oject have behavior (Methods/Functions): Actions the object can perform or that can be performed on it (e.g., a Car object might have accelerate(), brake(), getColor()).\n",
        "\n",
        "      2. Class -> A class is a blueprint or template for creating objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "           -> It defines the common attributes (variables) and methods (functions) that all objects of that particular type will have.\n",
        "\n",
        "           -> Example: The Car class defines that all cars will have a color attribute and an accelerate() method. Individual Car objects (like myBlueCar, yourRedTruck) are instances created from this Car class, each with its own specific values for the attributes (e.g., myBlueCar.color = \"blue\").\n",
        "\n",
        "   - The Four Pillars (Core Principles) of OOP:\n",
        "\n",
        "        1. Encapsulation -> Encapsulation refers to the bundling of data (attributes) and methods that operate on that data within a single unit (class). It restricts direct access to some of an object's components, preventing unintended modifications and ensuring data integrity.\n",
        "\n",
        "        2. Abstraction -> Abstraction involves hiding complex implementation details and exposing only essential information to the user. It simplifies the representation of objects, allowing users to interact with them at a higher level without needing to know the underlying mechanics.\n",
        "\n",
        "        3. Inheritence -> A mechanism where a new class (subclass or derived class) inherits attributes and methods from an existing class (superclass or base class). This models an \"is-a\" relationship (e.g., a Dog is-a Animal). Promotes code reuse (you don't have to rewrite common code).\n",
        "\n",
        "        4. Polymorphism -> Polymorphism, derived from the Greek words \"poly\" (many) and \"morphe\" (forms), signifies the ability of an object to take on multiple forms. In Python, this concept allows a function or method to operate on different types of objects, enhancing code flexibility and reusability.\n",

        "\n",
        "      4. The purpose of abstraction is to reduce complexity and isolate the impact of changes. Users interact with a simplified interface without needing to know the underlying mechanics.\n",

        "\n",

        "     - How Polymorphism Works with Inheritance:\n",
        "\n",
        "        1. Method Overriding : Subclasses inherit methods from the parent class but can override them to provide specific implementations.When a method is called on an object, Python determines the actual class of the object at runtime and invokes the corresponding method.\n",
        "\n",
        "        2. Shared Interface via Superclass : By defining a common interface in the parent class, you ensure that subclasses implement the necessary behaviors while retaining their unique characteristics.\n",
        "\n",
        "        3. Dynamic Method Resolution : Polymorphism relies on Python’s ability to determine at runtime which method should be executed based on the actual type of the object. This dynamic nature facilitates flexible and extensible designs.\n"

        "\n",
        "    - In method chaining, each method returns the object itself (self), so the next method can be called directly on it.\n",
